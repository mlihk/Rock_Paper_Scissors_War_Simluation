# Rock_Paper_Scissors_War_Simluation
Inspired by some reels I saw earlier

Where rock, paper, scissors goes to war, when ever one meets one, it will convert the loser into one of their kind.
Rock eats scissors,
scissors eat papers,
and paper eats rocks.

Simple put in the amount of RPS you want for each type, and the speed of the simulation (full integer, larger the number,
the faster the simulation will run)
